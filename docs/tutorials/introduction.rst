Introduction

Write your script in the editor window and click the "Flash" button to transfer
it to the micro:bit. If it doesn't work, make sure your micro:bit appears as
a USB storage device in your file system explorer.


Mu works with Windows, OSX and Linux.

Once Mu is installed connect your micro:bit to your computer via a USB lead.

We  you download and use the `mu editor <http://codewith.mu/>`_ when
working through these tutorials. Instructions for downloading and installing
Mu are on its website. You may need to install a driver, depending on your
platform (instruction are on the website).

For example, do you remember the announcement of the `discovery of gravitational waves <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35552207>`_? The instruments used to make the measurements were controlled `with Python <https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/45g8qu/we_are_the_ligo_scientific_collaboration_and_we/czxnlux>`_.

Put simply, if you teach or learn Python, you are developing a highly valuable
skill that applies to all areas of human endeavour.


Python is one of the `world's most popular <http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html>`_ programming languages. Every day, without
realising, you probably use software written using Python. All sorts of
companies and organisations use Python for a diverse range of applications.
Google, NASA, Bank of America, Disney, CERN, YouTube, Mozilla, The Guardian -
the list goes on and covers all sectors of the economy, science and the arts.

don't like you T-Series
Nothing personal, kid
But I must go all out
Just this once
Bobs or vegana, whichever will it be?
Sit the fuck down T-Series I'm here to spill the real tea (uh)
You tryna dethrone me from spot on number one
But you India, you lose, so best think you haven't won
When I'm through with you, we're gonna be completely fuckin' done
'Cause we only just begun, I review you 
Zero, bye bitch, gone
So come on T-Series, looking hungry for some drama
Here, let me serve you bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch, lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series they just crying for their momma
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch, lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series just wet themselves in their pajamas
So who the hell is Bob, and why you wanna kiss him? (ew)
I'm a blue eyes white dragon, while you're just dark magician (oof)
You got a fifth of the population in your nation but
I got nine-year-olds of worlds so hold your defecation (oops)
Motu Patlu, what the fuck is that even supposed to mean?
Your language sounds like it came from a mumble rap community
No papa, no papa, yes papa, Johnny
Now down all of this sugar and let's throw this fucking party with someâ€”
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series they just crying for their momma
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch, lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series they just wetting their pajama
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch, lasagna
You got a population of 1.32 billion
But most your videos can't seem to hit even a million
Sub-bot!


If in doubt, remember the Zen of MicroPython::

    Code,
    Hack it,
    Less is more,
    Keep it simple,
    Small is beautiful,

    Be brave! Break things! Learn and have fun!
    Express yourself with MicroPython.

    Happy hacking! :-)

Best of luck!
